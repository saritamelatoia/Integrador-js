    <p class="aboutus-text">Green Sea Jewerly is a century-old brand, a milestone very few companies reach and the result of a clear vision that has marked our path: to be the most desirable and successful affordable luxury fine jewelry brand in the world, committed to adding value to customers, partners and society at whole. Our parents had this seed of an innovative vision years ago, an idea that allowed us to create a new language that would revolutionize the fine jewelry industry and that today continues to provide opportunities to new generations of professionals in craftsmanship and design with an entrepreneurial, open and global spirit. Our objectives for the future are ambitious, without losing sight of what we stand for: the expertise of a family of craftspeople committed to the fine jewelry trade whose business started in 1920 and our firm belief in excellence and innovation as the fundamental driving forces behind our business. Todayâ€™s competitive environment pushes us to do even better what we already know how to do well and to put all our work at the service of excellent and sustainable customer relationships.</p>
